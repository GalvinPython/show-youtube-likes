# Archived
This project has now been archived and will no longer be recieving updates due to the latest YouTube update (though this was like ~October/November) being too much for me to work and focus on.

# Show YouTube Likes Extension
Show YouTube Likes is an extension for web browsers that displays the **full like count of a YouTube video**, instead of it being rounded to a million, or thousand etc.

# Layouts
YouTube will frequently do A/B testing, and thus the layout may change, affecting the elements for the like counter. If this is ever the case, file a bug report and I'll investigate. Presently, it only supports the current layout that was released late last year. This may not work with other extensions that change the theme of YouTube. All testing is done on the layout that I get at that time.

# Supported Browsers
This extension has been tested on the following:
* Chrome
* Edge

# Known Issues
* The like count flickers on livestreams

If you come across any issues, open an issue, and I'll investigate it.
