# Layouts
YouTube will frequently do A/B testing, and thus the layout may change, affecting the HTML for the like counter. If this is ever the case, file a bug report and I'll investigate. Currently, it only supports [this] layout

# Supported Areas
* Current:
 * Main video page
* Potentially:
 * YouTube Music
 * YouTube Community Posts
 * Comments (this is on the backburner. I can't imagine how painful this'd be)

# Supported Browsers
* Chrome

# Known Issues
* The like count flickers on livestreams
* May not update properly if you like/unlike
